> We choose to go to program color funcs in Bash, not because it is easy, but because it is hard. - *John F. Kennedy*

A bash script to perform color operations
In future, this will do a lot more - I hope!

Usage is currently:

`./spla.sh "#{color_code}"`

Returns a list of monochromatic colors

E.g ./spla.sh "#120E23"
Returns:

&#35;110E22, &#35;1F183C, &#35;2C2255
...and so on!

All help welcomed!

#####Disclaimer
This was an excercise to learn more about Bash scripting and is just a bit of fun. I will one day rewrite this in another language!
