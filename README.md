spla.sh
=======

A bash script to perform color operations
In future, this will do a lot more - I hope!

Usage is currently:

`./spla.sh "#{color_code}"`

Returns a list of monochromatic colors

E.g ./spla.sh "#120E23"
Returns:
#110E22
#1F183C
#2C2255
...and so on!

Please check the LICENSE file before getting your grubby paws on this!
